This package provides a `causal_tbl` class for causal inference. 
A `causal_tbl` is a subclass of `tibble` which keeps track of information on 
the roles of variables like treatment and outcome, 
and provides functionality to store models and their fitted 
values as columns in a data frame.

## Installation

You can install the development version of causaltbl from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("CoryMcCartan/causaltbl")
```

## Using `causaltbl`

A causal tibble, `causal_tbl`, is a data frame with attributes identifying which columns correspond to common inputs in causal inference analyses. At the most basic level, you can indicate the outcome and treatment columns. For more involved analyses, `causal_tbl`s can keep track of additional columns including multiple outcomes and multiple treatments.

The primary entryway to `causaltbl` is through <!--- [`tidycausal`](https://corymccartan.com/tidycausal/) -->. 
You can create a `causal_tbl` directly via `causal_tbl()`.

Suppose we have data from a really simple differences in differences design. Our data looks like this:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  id = c("a", "a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b", "b"),
  year = rep(2015:2018, 2),
  trt = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1),
  y = c(1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 5)
)
```

There are two units (`id`), `a` and `b`. We have 4 yearly observations from 2015 to 2018 (`year`) for each unit. `a` is never treated and `b` is treated in 2017 and 2018 (`trt`). Some outcome (`y`) is measured yearly.

We first can make a `causal_tbl` by passing `df` to `causal_tbl()`. We don't need to specify any options.

```{r}
library(causaltbl)
did <- causal_tbl(df)
```

Now `did` is a `causal_tbl` version of `df`.

```{r}
did
```

To set outcome , we can use the corresponding functions `set_outcome()`. `causal_tbl` uses tidy evaluation, so we can use the bare column name.

```{r}
did <- did |>
    set_outcome(outcome = y)
did
```

Similarly, we can indicate that `did` has a treatment column `trt` or panel structure for each `id`-`year` with the corresponding `set_treatment()` and `set_panel()` functions.

```{r}
did <- did |>
    set_treatment(treatment = trt) |>
    set_panel(unit = id, time = year)
did
```

This sets attributes that are used down-the-line by other packages. We can retrieve them by calling their `get`ters. For the outcome, `get_outcome()`:

```{r}
get_outcome(did)
```
For the treatment, `get_treatment()`:
```{r}
get_treatment(did)
```

And for the panel structure, `get_panel()`:
```{r}
get_panel(did)
```
